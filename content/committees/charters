# Charters

This document will be our starting point for collaborating on a multi-purpose charter that unifies all the committees of Secret Network.

We can develop examples of these for each and every committee, while thinking about how to frame a kind of "meta-governance committee"

That would provide common sources of truth in contextualized project groups working together, according to particular missions:
